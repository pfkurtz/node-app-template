# This is a template for building Node apps

#### Installation
`npm run init`

If you want to, change the info in `package.json` (but be very careful with dependencies), and alter or delete `bower.json`. If you delete `bower.json`, `bower init` will run as part of the initialization script. *NB: Installs several global Node modules, Bower, and Polymer* &mdash; cf. `init.sh`.

#### Run
`npm start`

#### Test
`npm test`
